# My Personal Doom Emacs Configuration

This is my personal configuration for [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), a fast, modern, and customizable Emacs configuration framework. 

## Installation

To use this configuration, you'll need to have Doom Emacs installed on your system. You can find instructions for installing Doom Emacs in the [official documentation](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#installation).

Once you have Doom Emacs installed, 
delete `~/.doom.d/` then you can clone this repository into your `~/.doom.d/` directory:

`git clone https://github.com/main-tech/doom_emacs_private_config.git ~/.doom.d`

## Features

This configuration includes the following features:

- **LSP:** Use Language Server Protocol (LSP) to get code completion and other language-aware features.
- **tree-sitter:** It enables you to generate concrete syntax tree from supported languages.
- **JavaScript:** 
- **Web:**
- **neotree:**  a project drawer, like NERDTree for vim


## Usage
After cloning to '~/.doom.d/' directory run: 
`~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync`

Then start Doom Emacs as you normally would:

Doom Emacs will automatically load this configuration from your `~/.doom.d/` directory.
